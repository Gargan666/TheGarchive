# Garry

The online representation of Centa, as well as it's own character. An undead, alternate version of the real life Centa.<br>
His name (at least in this universe) is Garry Oldum, although one may simply refer to him as Garry.

# Details

Garry is an enigmatic, spiritual being. He has a lanky physique and an appearance that is very similar to that of a sterotypical smiley face.<br>
He wears a blue double breasted suit with a light grey dress shirt and black tie. He also wears a blue cap with a black brim, reminiscent of a vintage postman's cap.<br>
<br>
He was made in 2018, being modified and rewritten over the span of those six, long years.

# Lore

Not much is known about Garry. However, there are some parts of his story that are known:<br>
<br>
Much like any other ghost, he used to be an actual person. More specifically, he used to be a popular show host somewhere around the 70's or 80's
who ran a show called "Stageplay". It consisted of contestants being given random roles they had to act out in front of a public audience.<br>
<br>
During one of these shows, a ceiling speaker fell onto Garry, crushing and killing him instantly. How the speaker fell despite being extremely well secured is entirely a mystery.<br>
<br>
Since then, Garry has been seen roaming the earth alone scaring innocent bystanders and getting people to do his bidding, seemingly for his own entertainment or benefit.
