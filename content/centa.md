# Centa

Centa (or Garry, as some people call him) is also a real person. He is one of Gargan's friends. Most of what we know of him comes from Gargan.

# History

Centa was born in 2009. He had a mostly uneventful life, and went on to move to a different country, where he now remains.<br>
He is also still alive.

# Hobbies

"Art" -

He's been drawing since somewhere around 2018, starting on a Roblox game called "Spray Paint". He switched to drawing on another game called "Free Draw", and then later switched to drawing digitally somewhere around 2021. You can be the judge on whether he improved or not.


Unfortunately, we couldn't find out anything else about this individual asides from this basic information and a sketch of what he possibly looks like, as he appears to be very discreet.<br>
