# Gargan (character)
<div class="similar-warn"><i>Did you mean <a href="entry.html?slug=garganirl">Gargan (real life)</a>?</i></div>
<br>
<br>
Both the online representation of Gargan and a character in and of itself. He is an alternate universe version of real life Gargan.
<br>
Referred to as Gargan, same as Gargan himself.
<br>

# Details
Gargan is an averagely tall male, sporting a red hoodie and gray pants. 
His face, under the hood, is completely dark, and his hair sticking out is directly connected and identically colored to his face.
<br>
He has one large, singular eye with a green outline and white fill.
<br>
<br>
Created and modified over the span of 6-ish years, he is the magnum opus of Gargan's character designs.
However, his lore and story are quite the mystery.
<br>

# Lore
Despite the mysterious nature of his lore, there are a few known details. 
<br>
<br>
An important piece of lore is that he used to be a regular human. He was not always this strange magical being.
<br>
His transformation is at least partially related to a place called 'The Void'.
<br>
<br>
It is also known that he simply resides somewhere on Earth, or at least, his universe's version of it.
