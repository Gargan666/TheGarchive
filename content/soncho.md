# Soncho

Soncho is an "EXE" designed originally by Red Heart Pink. It was created for a remix of the song Triple Trouble by Sunhatgirl. The remix (dubbed Triple trouble consoku mix) gained almost immediate infamy upon being released, and it went on to inspire Gargan to create a full remixed version of VS. EXE in the same musical style.<br>
Essentially, this version of Soncho is an alternative rendition of the character, partially created by Gargan. This rendition is part of Haunted Cartridge.
