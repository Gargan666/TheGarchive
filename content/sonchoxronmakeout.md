# Roncho

One of MANY depictions of "ooo scary ron WAAA", this one was created as a "side-exe" to Demon Duel.

# Lore

Roncho's lifecycle began within the void- (like many other exes)

While in it's origin, Roncho was neutral, no name, no form, no motives. A being purely existing for the sake of existing.

That is until he witnessed "Soncho" of Haunted Cartridge fame.



*he was starstruck.*



becoming OBSESSED with the Sonic-esque entity, it dedicated it's life to uncovering everything there is to know about it, eventually basing it's own form and name on the being- gaining the name of "Roncho". Even making his own world and "victims" to appear closer to the demonic hedgehog.

Nowadays, he awaits in his domain, awaits for a poor soul to join him in glorified fanfiction.
