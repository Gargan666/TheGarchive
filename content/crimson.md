# Crimson

Last in a series of many sinister depictions of <a href="entry.html?slug=garganchar">Gargan</a>.
In-universe he goes by many names, however 'CRIMSON' is his true name. <br>
He was conceived in 2025. <br>

# Lore

Long ago, during the 16th century, Crimson was born as a regular human. He was of high caste, however not royalty.

In his childhood, he took a liking to unexplainable phenomena. At first it was a fascination with natural phenomena that, at the time, were entirely unknowable. However, later in life, it developed into an archaic obsession. <br>
By his 20's his curiosity had developed further, now being an interest in anomalous phenomena. Things that defy reason.

He formed a cult around his beliefs and findings, and with the growing group, worshipped these anomalies. <br>
His influence spread far and wide, and his freedom grew larger. Now that he could do practically anything, he sought to inherit powers from that which he worshipped. <br>

He would not succeed in this until the end of his life when, during his final moments, an ancient demon turned ally spoke to him. <br>
It told him of its own plight. <br>
It told him of its hatred of lower beings. <br>
It told him, "YOU ARE WORTHY." <br>
Right before Crimson's life ended, power was coarsed through his veins. The power of a fallen god was his, and his alone. <br>
The caveat being that he could only use it in acts of sin. Unfortunately, that's exactly what he wanted to do. <br><br>

His rampage upon earth was brutal. It lasted 3 days, in which he took calculated steps to overthrow all of society. <br>

On the first day, he rallied his followers. He ordered they commit crimes all over the world.

On the second, he killed all government officials. Every officer, every commander, every monarch and every dictator.

On the third (and last) day, he declared all of earth his to rule. Mass panic spread through the masses.

The massacre was only ended on the fourth day. A secret society of powerful sorcerers stepped in to stop Crimson. <br>
His form was constrained, and his mind sealed away. The dream realm served as his eternal tomb.<br>

Now he resides within his prison, waiting for his grand return.
