# Ron

Ron, similarly to many other original characters on this wiki, is both an online representation and a standalone character (though it usually leans towards a representation)

# DETAILS

Ron is a tall robot, his limbs taller than his body, giving him an unnatural appearance. His head resembles that of a digital file found in a computer- and his face stuck in a constant smile, his hands are big- and his fingers clawed, sharp enough to rip through wood with ease. exposed wires litter his body, giving him the energy required to function.

# LORE

Everything that is known about Ron is only spoken through public eyewitness' as most other information is classified, known attributes include:

He appears to be made of spare parts in a storage warehouse, said warehouse was later found. Though the inside was empty, there were drawing on the wall, presumably of things R0-11 remembers.

He is drawn to CRT TV's, or with anything that takes in radio signals and/or lets out white noise, once he was seen blankly staring at a public payphone for hours on straight.

He appears to be intelligent, his movements having intention behind them- though he refuses to communicate with anyone that tried to initiate contact, scuttering away the second he notices someone.
