# Gargan (real life)
<i style="background-color:black;">Did you mean <a href="entry.html?slug=garganchar">Gargan (character)</a>?</i>

Gargan is in fact, a real person. Woah. He is instrumental to the production of this website, obviously.
<br>
Most of what we know of him is of his word. If he tells lies, this page contains wrong information.
<br>
<br>

# History
Gargan was born in 2009, mere days after the 11th of september. He went on to move houses twice, to where he now resides.
<br>
It is unknown exactly how he <strong class="obfuscated">WENT tO ThE moRGUE</strong>, but it is apparent he <strong class="obfuscated">found god</strong>.
<br>
Despite everything though, it's important that he's still alive. After all, this wiki wouldn't even exist without his involvement.

# Hobbies
Art -
<br>
He has been doing art since he was about the age of 5. He switched to drawing digitally in 2020.
<br>
He uses this skill mostly to draw silly and/or ridicilous things, however, sometimes he puts actual effort into his artworks.
<br>
<br>
Music -
<br>
Since 2020, his main goal has been getting good at composing music. You can be the judge on if he has succeeded yet.
<br>
There will be many examples of his music on this wiki. We don't need to put it here.
<br>
<br>
Programming -
<br>
He has been coding for a while. Around 2019 was when he started.
<br>
He isn't an excellent or an extremely talented programmer, but he is enough. 
<br>
He does use a lot of AI help, though.
