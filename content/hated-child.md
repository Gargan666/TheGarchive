# The Hated Child
Do you really need to know anything about her? Everyone knows her. If you don't you're not a real one.

For the fakes, Lily was a little girl, she was afraid of the big wide world. Because she grew up within her castle walls. One day when the sun sat, she ran away into the woods, and she was all alone. They all warned her "DON'T GO THERE!!! THERE'S CREATURES HIDING IN THE DARK!".<br>
Then something came creeping, it told her, "Dont you worry, just follow everywhere I go. Top of all the mountains or valley low. I'll give you everything you've been dreaming of... Just let me in!". She wouldn't give in.<br>
"Everything you want in gold<br>
I'll be the magic story you've been told. And you'll be safe under my control. Just let me in!!!".<br>
She knew she was hypnotized. But then she ran fast and started screaming, "Is there someone out there?<br>
Please help me, come get me!!!"<br>
She could hear something behind her, hearing it say something about her being under it's control.

...<br>
Now that Lily came home, she had to take a DNA test to be let in and to check if she was still healthy. And strangely they found out that she was the Queen and Kings daughter!!! They had been searching for her ever since she was kidnapped as a baby.<br>
Since Lily was abused by her other parents and the spoiled bratty "twin" sister, she made the choice to imprison them. But later on the sister was released due to good behaviour, she regretted what she did to Lily and wanted to apologise for her past actions.

Later on Lily is the Queen of the land and has two children. The sister as her personal maid and aunt of her children.
