title: Template page (this is shown in the search bar and at the top of the page)
slug: single word for simplicity (usually the first word of the title with lowercase, for example for this it would be 'template')
categories:
  - first category shown at the bottom of the page
  - second category
  - third category
  - add more '-' with text after to add it to more categories
